## Overview

QR code component- The first and easiest challenge that one can do on Frontend Mentor. I accepted this challenge and present you *my solution* of the challenge.

I made this static website using basic HTML5 and CSS3 as for now that is what I know. I tried my best to be exact in design and I hope you like it.

## My process

I started by deciding how many divs I want:
* one for the actual card i.e. the container that'll contain my image and text. {**class="container"**}
  - one image tag for QR code.
  - one h1 tag for main heading.
  - one p tag for summary.
* one for my footer.

Then I used CSS properties to put margin, padding, color, shadows, etc. to style it. Also, I used CSS position properties and Flexbox to center my content.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
